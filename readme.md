OBJECTIVE

The task is to use a 5x5 window to scan over the greyscale image, where a pixel value is a float in the range 0 to 1.

The values have to be normalised so that within one window the smallest value is scaled to 0 and the largest to 1.

scikit-image must be used.

EXPECTED OUTPUT

Export data to .csv, in a table with 25 columns and 13,824 rows.
